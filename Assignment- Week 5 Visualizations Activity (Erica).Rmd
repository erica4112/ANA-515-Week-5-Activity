## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, include=FALSE}
#.	Code chunk to create a subset of countries

# Assuming 'data' is your original data frame from the CSV file
# Create a new dataset named 'filtered'
filtered <- data %>%
  filter(population_share <= 1.0)

# Display the structure of the 'filtered' data frame
str(filtered)

# Display the first few rows of the 'filtered' data frame
head(filtered)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Using the summary() function
summary(filtered)


```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#	Write inline code 
```

We have data about `r nrow(data)` countries. Only `r nrow(data) - nrow(filtered)`  have a population share of greater than 1.0. The distribution of this is shown below: 

## Including Plots
```{r}

# Create a histogram of one variable (e.g., 'mpg')
hist(filtered$population_share, main = "Histogram of population_share", xlab = "population_share", ylab = "Frequency")

# Create a scatterplot of two variables (e.g., 'mpg' vs. 'hp')
plot(filtered$population_share, mtcars$gdp_weighted_share, main = "Scatterplot of population_share vs. gdp_weighted_share", 
     xlab = "population_share", ylab = "gdp_weighted_share")

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
